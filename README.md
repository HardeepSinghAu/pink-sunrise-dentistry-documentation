### **User stories**
1. As a busy person, I am always on the go. I don't want to call my dentist and have to wait on hold to talk to someone to book. I want to be able to go online and book at the click of a button and get on with my day.

2. As the Office Manager, I have a lot of admin, booking fees to process, patients to manage. Sometimes the phone is ringing off the hook with people who want to book an appointment. It would take a load off my plate to be able to have patients book themselves in so that I can get on with other tasks, such as taking care of the patients in the clinic.

3. As someone who has a hectic schedule, I like to be able to see which appointments are available and book in the one that best suits my schedule. Being able to book my dentist appointment on line, would definitely help me in doing that.

**Follow up market research**
1. As a patient using this website, it would be handy to recieve and email or text confirming the appointment to know that yes it has indeed been booked.

2. As the administrator, it would be nice to be able to add an update alert of news at the clinic, such as new treatments we may have started offering or any discounted treatments and other news.
