### **User stories**
1. As a busy person, I am always on the go. I don't want to call my dentist and have to wait on hold to talk to someone to book. I want to be able to go online and book at the click of a button and get on with my day.

2. As the Office Manager, I have a lot of admin, booking fees to process, patients to manage. Sometimes the phone is ringing off the hook with people who want to book an appointment. It would take a load off my plate to be able to have patients book themselves in so that I can get on with other tasks, such as taking care of the patients in the clinic.

3. As someone who has a hectic schedule, I like to be able to see which appointments are available and book in the one that best suits my schedule. Being able to book my dentist appointment on line, would definitely help me in doing that.

**Follow up market research**
1. As a patient using this website, it would be handy to recieve and email or text confirming the appointment to know that yes it has indeed been booked.

2. As the administrator, it would be nice to be able to add an update alert of news at the clinic, such as new treatments we may have started offering or any discounted treatments and other news.

> "Teamwork makes the dreamwork"

When we set about this project, we had a very clear idea of the features this project should entail, a booking system for the client who is a Dentist currently with a very small online presence. The app needed to include features that allowed Users to login and book an appointment online effortlessly. Additionally, we needed to include a contact form so that they could contact the Clinic and ask questions about more complex treatments. 

We started off with a Scrum where we discussed the features of the projects and what we would need to create overall. We also discussed the tech stack we preferred to use and how it would be more beneficial to the project over any other tech stack either of us were familiar with.

We created a Trello Board and broke the project down into smaller tasks and listed them as cards under two backlog categories, documentation and coding. We then created a further two columns titled Leith and Hardeep, where we would place tasks being managed by the respective team member. Lastly we had a column for completed tasks to move the cards into once those tasks had been fully completed. We chose to use Trello as it was a tool we were both familar with and felt it would be a good way to delegate the tasks, visually keep track of our own tasks, see what our team mate was working on as well as keep track of the tasks listed in the two backlogs.

Our live Trello Board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/GTJg7qxU/dentist-booking-system-website) as well as a directory of daily screenshots 

We used Discord to communicate with each other regularly, here we discussed the tasks we were working on as well as ask one another queries and clarifications to ensire we were on the same page
