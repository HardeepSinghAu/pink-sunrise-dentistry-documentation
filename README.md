### **User stories**
“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”

1. As a busy person, I am always on the go. I don't want to call my dentist and have to wait on hold to talk to someone to book. I want to be able to go online and book at the click of a button and get on with my day.

2. As the Office Manager, I have a lot of admin, booking fees to process, patients to manage. Sometimes the phone is ringing off the hook with people who want to book an appointment. It would take a load off my plate to be able to have patients book themselves in so that I can get on with other tasks, such as taking care of the patients in the clinic.

3. As someone who has a hectic schedule, I like to be able to see which appointments are available and book in the one that best suits my schedule. Being able to book my dentist appointment on line, would definitely help me in doing that.

4. I'm a very anxious person and dislike getting on the phone to make appointments, being able to do this online without having to interact with another person will help me massively with being able to access a dentist and keeping on top of my dental health. Now if only I could do that without interacting with the dentist!

5. As a Mum of three, I regularly book the Dental appointments for my family and I. It would be handy to be able to access a history of treatments so that I can keep track of when a family member last visited so I can book them in after 6 month intervals.

6. I have a lot of dental work done due to a health issue, sometimes it's a challenge to keep track of it all with my other medical expenses and needs. It would be invaluable to me, to be able to see my treatment history and what is owed so that I can budget and plan to pay back the balance in due course.

7. As a small business owner, I can't afford the time to wait on hold for 20 mins to speak to the receptionist to do something as simple as lock in an appointment. In this day and age, this should really be an effortless online process.

**Follow up market research**

1. As a patient using this website, it would be handy to receive and email or text confirming the appointment to know that yes it has indeed been booked.

2.

3.  

**Feedback from consultation with the client**

1. As the administrator, it would be nice to be able to add an update alert of news at the clinic, such as new treatments we may have started offering or any discounted treatments and other news.

### **Scrums and Sprints**
When we set about this project, we had a very clear idea of the features this project should entail, a booking system for the client who is a Dentist currently with a very small online presence. The app needed to include features that allowed Users to login and book an appointment online effortlessly. Additionally, we needed to include a contact form so that they could contact the Clinic and ask questions about more complex treatments. 

We started off with a Scrum where we discussed the features of the projects and what we would need to create overall. We also discussed the tech stack we preferred to use and how it would be more beneficial to the project over any other tech stack either of us were familiar with. We decided to hold a daily stand-up to ensure we both had a plan of attack for the day and were on same page. At the end of each week we also conducted sprint demo to share our achievements and then moved on to sprint planning to determin which tasks to execute in the upcoming sprint.We also did a review of the sprint and noted these down on a weekly Trello card of key tasks that we completed that sprint, tasks that went well in the sprint, things that hadn't gone well.

### **Trello Board for Project Management and task Delegation**
We created a Trello Board and broke the project down into smaller tasks and listed them as cards under two backlog categories, documentation and coding. We then created a further two columns titled Leith and Hardeep, where we would place tasks being managed by the respective team member. Lastly we had weekly columns for completed tasks to move the cards into once those tasks had been fully completed per sprint. 

We chose to use Trello as it was a tool we were both familar with and felt it would be a good way to delegate the tasks, visually keep track of our own tasks, see what our team mate was working on as well as keep track of the tasks listed in the two backlogs.

Our live Trello Board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/GTJg7qxU/dentist-booking-system-website) as well as a directory of daily screenshots.

| **6** | 21/10/2022 to 23/11/2022 | z | Project due to be completed in full by the 23rd of November |

### **Discord**
As we have collaborated over the course, we are already familiar with each others working style and dedication to the project. As we already use discord as a primary mean of communication with one another we decided to continue using discord to discuss and work on the project. We used Discord to communicate with each other regularly throughout the day. Here we discussed the tasks we were working on as well as ask one another queries and clarifications to ensure we were on the same page.

We decided that instead of delegating tasks to one another we would volunteer for tasks that we felt confident in being able to complete successfully. Leith took on the mammoth and key task of getting the rails backend up and running as well as organising the ERD. He felt confident in the former task as he had already put this into practice recently. He also felt it was important for him to map out the ERD so that he had a good understanding of the tables he needed to create for the backend. The tables we would use and relationships between them, were discussed at length between us before Leith used [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to create an ERD.

I (Hardeep) decided to make a dent in the documentation as the client had requested this at an earlier date and having a good understanding of markdown and the requirments for the document I decided to intilly focus on that(current document). As I had recently taken part in a hackthon using React and enjoyed creating components I also decided to intialise a repo connected to a directory with the framework for the front-end.

#AS THE WEEKS GO ON WE SHOULD DISCUSS MORE TASKS WE COMPLETED AND WHY EACH TEAM MEMBER TOOK THAT TASK....because reasons
### **Wireframes for multiple standard screen sizes**

(We can probably remove this heading and the one below as we have a seperate folder for these.)
